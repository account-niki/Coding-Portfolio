    <h2>Growing Interest in Tech</h2>
    <p>Throughout my studies and career, I naturally gravitated towards data collection, data organization, and streamlining systems to optimize their functionality for users and employees. It dawned on me that the tech field would allow me to explore and strengthen these skills further. Tech includes logical approaches with the ability to create and build massive creations with a diverse team. As I've explored coding, it became fascinating uncovering all the limitless features code can automatically create.
      With technology exponentially growing, I aim to continue growing alongside it.</p>
